#CS 201 Final Project: Connect4 Game
#Project Submitters: Doug and Ali 

"Connect Four" by Ali Ramazani and Doug Thompson. This project is the connect four game. The user chooses a column and then an 'X' will be put in the lowest possible row for that column. After that, the AI will put an 'O' in a random column. Both the user and the AI will continue to play until one of them has a "connect four", when four of the same types of pieces (Xs or Os) are connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. At that point, the winner is declared and the game is over.
